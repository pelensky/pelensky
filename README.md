## Working Hours
I primarily operate within the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7), although I frequently travel and adjust my work schedule to align with my current location. I prefer to start and finish work early (ie. 7:30-15:30), starting my day with a gym session and promptly diving into work.

When traveling, I strive to maintain a similar routine, taking into account time zones and other obligations.

## Communication
You can reach me through Slack, which I check at least once an hour even when doing focused work. I check my email twice a day (start and end of the day). If you need to reach me, it's best to send me a Slack message. I prefer not to receive phone calls or unexpected video calls, but I am always available for pre-planned video calls. I usually turn on my video during calls and appreciate if you do the same, but please don't feel obliged if you're not comfortable with it.

## Meetings
I believe that meetings should only be held if necessary, and their outcome can't be achieved through emails or written communication. In my experience, the same people tend to speak the most in meetings and usually the loudest person gets their way. I find with written communication, people are able to be more considered, and those who may not speak up as much in meetings can have their points heard.

## Feedback
I embrace feedback as a means of growth and improvement. I believe that all feedback is kind, and that feedback from those I respect is always intended to help me grow; this goes both ways, and I strive to share feedback as much as possible. I aim to provide constructive feedback, phrasing my feedback as questions where possible, and amplify my colleagues by sending public shoutouts. I always strive to deliver my feedback gently, and appreciate receiving it in this way as well.
