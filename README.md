## Purpose of this document
Communication is hard. This is a bit of an insight into my mind.

## Feedback
> All Feedback is Kind - [Dana Svoboda](http://www.chiefjoyofficer.com/)

A game changer for me was rethinking feedback. There is no such thing as 'positive' or 'negative' feedback. Feedback is intended to help people grow.

This is an oversimiplication, and for every rule there are multiple exceptions, but I choose to assume positive intent, and that feedback from people I respect is always them trying to help me on my journey. 

Because of this, I give _a lot_ of feedback. I am not implying that I am an expert in anything, just how I may have done something differently.

Always challenge me on something you don't agree with, and/or tell me if I'm getting too much.

In adition, I ask that you give me as much constructive feedback as possible, as I want to continue to grow.

## Working Hours
I get in to work somewhere between 8.30am and 8.45am, and aim to be out the door by 5.30pm at the latest.

I like to eat lunch outside if it's sunny, and in a group if people are around. I make a point of never eating by myself at my desk and continuing to work.
