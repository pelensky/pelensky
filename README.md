## Purpose of this document
Communication is hard, but effective communication is one of _the_ most important factors for a healthy team. This document provides an insight into my mind, and how I work.

## Working Hours
I get in to work between 8.30am and 8.45am, and aim to be out the door by no later than 5.30pm.

I like to eat lunch outside if it's sunny, and in a group if people are around. I make a point of never eating by myself at my desk and continuing to work.

I have Slack on my phone, but notifications disabled.

## Reaching me
Slack is the easiest way to get in touch with me, and I have it on at all times while I'm at work. If I really need to focus I won't check it constantly, but I check at a minimum once an hour.

I only check email at the start and the end of the day.

Please don't call me on the phone - I am uncomfortable when my phone rings when I'm not expecting it to (I think a symptom of working in a call centre in a country in which I had an accent).

I am always happy to have a Slack Call, Google Hangout or Zoom meeting if we plan one; even as simple as sending a Slack message "Hey, can we have a quick call about XYZ" the answer will either be "I'm free now!" or "I'll be free at ${time}!"

I always turn my video on when we have a call, and would appreciate if you do the same.

## Meetings
If the outcome of a meeting can be communicated or decided in an email or Slack conversation I would prefer we didn't have the meeting.

I am quite protective of my time, so if I a meeting is optional for me, please let me know. 

Please don't be offended if I leave a meeting if I don't feel I can add anything to it or it is not relevant to me and my work. That said if I am leaving a meeting and you would prefer for me to stay, please let me know, and I will be happy to stay.

## Feedback
> All Feedback is Kind - [Dana Svoboda](http://www.chiefjoyofficer.com/)

A game changer for me was rethinking feedback. There is no such thing as 'positive' or 'negative' feedback. Feedback is intended to help people grow, and a gift from the person giving it.

This is an over-simiplication, and for every rule there are multiple exceptions, but I choose to assume positive intent and that feedback from people I respect is always them trying to help me on my journey.

Because of this, I give _a lot_ of feedback. I am not implying that I am an expert in anything - my feedback is generally just how I may have done something differently. If I am providing feedback, it is because I care about you and/or the project we are working on, and want you to succeed.

Always challenge me on something you don't agree with, and/or tell me if I'm getting too much or too picky.

I aim to deliver feedback gently, in a non-confrontationl, friendly way. I tend to raise PR feeback as questions where possible.

I ask that you give me as much constructive feedback as possible as I want to continue to grow. Please be mindful of delivering it gently.

## I am actively trying to avoid, and would appreciate being called out if you see me:
- Not using inclusive language (ie. saying 'Guys' rather that 'Folks')
- Talking over others, even when I get excited
- Talking down about myself or my skills
- Overextending myself
