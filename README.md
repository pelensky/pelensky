# Dan Pelensky - Personal README

## Introduction
This document provides as an insight into my work history, work style and how to effectively communicate with me. The overarching theme is that I believe believe clear and kind communication is key, as it is essential for a productive and healthy team.

## About Me
I am a passionate and experienced Software Engineer with a strong focus on writing quality, fully tested, and extensible code. I am a pragmatist who understands when and how to apply these principles in real-world scenarios. I value inclusivity, feedback, communication, and continual growth.

As a polyglot engineer, I have worked with a variety of different languages, technologies, and paradigms, allowing me to quickly pick up new tools and technologies as needed.

I enjoy working remotely and communicating asynchronously, and offer my services on a contract basis through my company, Pelensky Technology Inc.

## Working Hours
My typical work hours are 7:30am to 3-4pm. I prefer to start my day with a gym session and start work immediately after. I aim to maintain similar hours while traveling, considering time zones and other commitments.

When in person I enjoy socializing with my colleagues, especially over lunch. Slack is my preferred mode of communication and I have it on at all times, but with notifications disabled.

## Communication
You can reach me through Slack, which I check at least once an hour even when doing focused work. I only check my email twice a day (start and end of the day). If you need to reach me, it's best to send me a Slack message. I prefer not to receive phone calls or unexpected video calls, but I am always available for pre-planned video calls. I usually turn on my video during calls and appreciate if you do the same, but please don't feel obliged if you're not comfortable with it.

## Meetings
I believe that meetings should only be held if necessary, and their outcome can't be achieved through emails or Slack conversations. If I am not required to attend a meeting, please let me know. If I am invited to a meeting, I would appreciate an agenda in advance, and I try to avoid recurring status update meetings.

## Feedback
I embrace feedback as a means of growth and improvement. I believe that all feedback is kind, and that feedback from those I respect is always intended to help me grow; this goes both ways, and I strive to share feedback as much as possible. I aim to provide constructive feedback, phrasing my feedback as questions where possible, and amplify my colleagues by sending public shoutouts. I always strive to deliver my feedback gently, and appreciate receiving it in this way as well.

## Personal Goals
I am continuously working on personal growth and strive to avoid:

* Using exclusive language (ie. calling a group of people 'guys')
* Interrupting others even when I am excited about a topic
* Negative self-talk
* Overextending myself
If you notice me engaging in any of these behaviors, I would appreciate you bringing it to my attention.
